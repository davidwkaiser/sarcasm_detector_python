# Sarcasm Detector
A model created to classify a text as sarcastic or not.

Creates a Document Text Matrix (DTM), on which a clasification model is trained to label a comment as sarcastic or not.

Trained and tested on a random sample drawn from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sherinclaudia/sarcastic-comments-on-reddit) of 1M Reddit comments which were tagged (or not) by the author as sarcastic, evenly split.

This project was originally created in R, for my Data Science Fundamentals class. I am now recreating in Python so I can deploy.
